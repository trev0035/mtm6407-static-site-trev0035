  <h2>What Do Plants Need?</h2>
  
  <div class="needs-container">
    <div class="need-card">
      <h3>Water</h3>
      <img src="/assets/images/watering.jpg" alt="Watering a plant">
      <p>Plants need water to live, but different plants need different amounts! Some plants like to stay moist, while others prefer to dry out between waterings. Check the soil with your finger - if it feels dry about an inch down, it's probably time to water.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="need-card">
      <h3>Sunlight</h3>
      <img src="/assets/images/sunlight.jpg" alt="Plant in sunlight">
      <p>Plants need sunlight to make their food through a process called photosynthesis. Some plants love lots of direct sun, while others prefer shade. Make sure your plants get the right amount of light for their type!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="need-card">
      <h3>Soil</h3>
      <img src="/assets/images/soil.jpg" alt="Potting soil">
      <p>Soil gives plants nutrients and support for their roots. Different plants like different types of soil. Most houseplants like potting soil that drains well and isn't too heavy.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="need-card">
      <h3>Air</h3>
      <img src="/assets/images/air.jpg" alt="Plant leaves">
      <p>Plants breathe too! They take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen through tiny holes in their leaves. Make sure your plants have good air circulation.</p>

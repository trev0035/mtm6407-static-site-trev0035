  <h2>About the Creator</h2>

      <p>
        Hi there! I'm Regina Trevs, the creator of Plant Wonders. I'm a student with a passion for both web development and plants. I created this website as a project for my MTM6407 course at Algonquin College.
      </p>
      <p>
        My love for plants began when I was a child, tending to my grandmother's garden. I believe that connecting children with nature at an early age helps them develop a sense of wonder and responsibility for our environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope this website inspires kids (and adults too!) to learn more about the plant world and maybe even start growing some green friends of their own!
